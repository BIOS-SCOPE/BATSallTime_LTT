# BATSallTime_LTT
CTD casts through all time at BATS; use 2db resolution data\
Krista Longnecker, 4 April 2025

## Notes go here
This was done in MATLAB in order to best use Ruth Curry's code organizing the BATS CTD data and for making calculations of BV frequency (using the SEAWATER library from CSIRO).

Could save a CSV with the results, but remember that file will be large (too large for GitHub)

Main file is in MATLAB : ([getBATSdata_LTT_KLv1.m](https://github.com/redbluewater/BATSallTime_LTT/blob/main/getBATSdata_LTT_KLv1.m))

Here is a JPG with the results - two subplots (top is using the 2db CTD data and bottom is the plot from the data in the Excel file):
